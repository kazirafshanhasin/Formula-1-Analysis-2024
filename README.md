# Formula-1-Analysks
This repository contains Python code to analyze and visualize Formula 1 lap times and pit stops for two drivers from two different races in the 2024 season. The analysis includes fetching data from the Ergast API, processing and displaying average lap times and pit stop durations, and solving differential equations to model lap times and pit stops.
